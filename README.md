# RockðŸ‘Š Paperâœ‹ ScissorsâœŒ

- Rock, Paper, Scissors is a fun game you can play with your computer. It's like making funny shapes with your hand! There are three shapes you can choose: rock (make a fist), paper (flat hand), and scissors (two fingers like a peace sign).

- Here's how you play: you and the computer both pick one of the shapes, and then you show them at the same time. Rock crushes scissors, scissors cuts paper, and paper covers rock. That's how you figure out who wins!

- If you and the computer pick the same shape, it's a tie, and you can play again. It's a quick and exciting game, and you can keep playing as many times as you want. Have fun and see if you can beat the computer!
